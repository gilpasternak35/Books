# Books I think everyone should read:

The following is a list of books I believe are truly worth a read, organized by both STEM and non-STEM readings and not sorted in any particular

**Algorithms to Live By** - Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths

**Mathematics for Computer Science** - Eric Lehman

**Thinking Fast and Slow** - Daniel Khaneman

**The Signal and the Noise** - Nate Silver
