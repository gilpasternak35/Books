# Gil's Must Reads:

The following is a list of books I believe are truly worth a read, organized by both STEM and non-STEM readings and not sorted in any particular
order. All these books have changed my worldview and greatly contributed to the person I am today.

## STEM-ish
### Algorithms to Live By - Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths

Probably the best "idea book" I've read in a while. If you're looking for inspiration in the automation of human decision making. This book is the 
best place to find it. It explains complex ideas in a very clear way.

### Mathematics for Computer Science - Eric Lehman

A Math textbook whose first 6-7 chapters explain math in the most exciting way I've seen it explained. A must read for anyone 
who wants to learn Math-CS fundamentals in a way that won't bore.

### Thinking Fast and Slow - Daniel Khaneman

A book that has been very monumental in my life, *Thinking Fast and Slow* explains how seemingly "intuitive decisions" often come on the basis of irrationality and that true thought activation is an expense people frequently would subconciously rather avoid. A must read for anyone interested in Math, the human brain, or Statistics.

### The Signal and the Noise - Nate Silver

A book that explains a Statistical worldview as well as I've seen it explained anywhere. Becomes somewhat of a repetitive read at some point, but gives a really powerful introduction to Bayesian thinking.

### Moneyball - Michael Lewis

*Moneyball* is frankly meant for entertainment, but it is a very powerful testimony to the power of algorithmic optimization. This book helped kickstart my love for Statistics and Analytics.



## Non-STEM
### How to win Friends and Influence People - Dale Carnegie

A book that has transformed my own self image and has really helped me improve myself as a person. My obsession with this book lies not so much with Carnegie's tips, but rather with his way of thinking, which lays down the foundation of being a likeable person: stop being so self-obsessed for once, and show your loved ones you legitimately care about them.

### The Fountainhead - Ayn Rand

Deeply entrenched as one of my 2-3 favorite books of all time, the Fountainhead is a captivating story that teaches the value of exceptionalism, expertise, and dedication.

### A Brave New World - Aldous Huxley

A brilliantly written story that really helped increase my self-awareness. A powerful testament to the idea that culture is defined by leaders, and very frequently so is paradigm.

### The Gulag Archipelago - Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn

Fascinating tale of human courage, suffering, and tyranny. Worth reading merely on the basis of the shock value of the grossly inhuman conditions of the Russian Gulags.

### Outliers- Malcolm Gladwell

I think the point that most people took from this is that the world's most successful people are the way they are because they got lucky, but I personally love this book because I think it is a powerful testament to the value of combining hard work with a strong culture and good parenting. Luck, however, is also an inevitable aspect of life that people often neglect and this book certainly stresses it's importance.

### Cat's Cradle - Kurt Vonnecut

Quite easily my favorite book of all time. A brilliantly fabricated story that shines a light upon the conflicting forces that control our everyday life: inspiration, innovation, storytelling, lying, and relative beauty.
