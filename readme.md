# Gil's Must Reads:

The following is a list of books I believe are truly worth a read, organized by both STEM and non-STEM readings and not sorted in any particular
order. All these books have changed my worldview and greatly contributed to the person I am today.

## STEM-ish
### Algorithms to Live By - Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths

Probably the best "idea book" I've read in a while. If you're looking for inspiration in the automation of human decision making. This book is the 
best place to find it. It explains complex ideas in a very clear way.

### Thinking Fast and Slow - Daniel Khaneman

A book that has been very monumental in my life, *Thinking Fast and Slow* explains how seemingly "intuitive decisions" often come on the basis of irrationality and that true thought activation is an expense people frequently would subconciously rather avoid. A must read for anyone interested in Math, the human brain, or Statistics.

### The Signal and the Noise - Nate Silver

A book that explains a Statistical worldview as well as I've seen it explained anywhere. Becomes somewhat of a repetitive read at some point, but gives a really powerful introduction to Bayesian thinking.

### Moneyball - Michael Lewis

*Moneyball* is frankly meant for entertainment, but it is a very powerful testimony to the power of algorithmic optimization. This book helped kickstart my love for Statistics and Analytics.



## Non-STEM
### How to win Friends and Influence People - Dale Carnegie

A book that has transformed my own self image and has really helped me improve myself as a person. My obsession with this book lies not so much with Carnegie's tips, but rather with his way of thinking, which lays down the foundation of being a likeable person: stop being so self-obsessed for once, and show your loved ones you legitimately care about them.

### The Fountainhead - Ayn Rand

Deeply entrenched as one of my 2-3 favorite books of all time, the Fountainhead is a captivating story that teaches the value of exceptionalism, expertise, and dedication.

### A Brave New World - Aldous Huxley

A brilliantly written story that really helped increase my self-awareness. A powerful testament to the idea that culture is defined by leaders, and very frequently so is paradigm.

### The Gulag Archipelago - Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn

Fascinating tale of human courage, suffering, and tyranny. Worth reading merely on the basis of the shock value of the grossly inhuman conditions of the Russian Gulags.

### Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy (whole series) - Douglas Adams
Hilarious, very insightful, and the ultimate way to start reading science fiction. Would recommend to practically anyone, just on the basis that reading about the relatively pathetic life of Arthur Dent will improve anyone's bad day, not to mention that the book contains the answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything and the answer to an even bigger question that has plagued the mind of many for centuries: "Where shall we eat?"

### Cat's Cradle - Kurt Vonnecut

Quite easily my favorite book of all time. A brilliantly fabricated story that shines a light upon the conflicting forces that control our everyday life: inspiration, innovation, storytelling, lying, and relative beauty.
